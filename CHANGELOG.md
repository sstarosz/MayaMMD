## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-01

### Added

- **PMX model import** — full MMD model import:
  - Mesh geometry — positions, normals, UVs, triangle faces
  - Bone hierarchy — full parent/child structure with tail joints
  - BDEF1/2/4 smooth skinning
  - Per-face materials via `openPBRSurface` with diffuse textures and opacity
  - Vertex morphs as Maya blendShapes
  - Bone morphs via a custom `boneMorphNode` DG node
  - Rigid body visual guides (physics not yet implemented)
  - PMX file validation before import
  - Custom attributes for scene metadata (`pmxBoneData`, `pmxMorphMapping`, rest pose)
- **VMD motion import** — load MMD motion data:
  - Bone keyframe animation (translation + quaternion rotation)
  - Quaternion SLERP interpolation with Bezier curves
  - Morph weight animation for blendShape and bone morph targets
  - IK-compatible playback via the custom CCD solver
- **VPD pose import** — apply MMD pose data with optional keyframing
- **Custom CCD IK solver** — `ccdIKSolverNode` registered as a Maya IK solver, with per-joint angle limits and chain priorities
- **INHERIT_ROTATION / INHERIT_TRANSLATION** constraints with influence scaling
- **Dockable UI** — Maya workspaceControl panel with PMX/VMD/VPD import, pose editor with morph weight sliders, and Reset to Bind Pose
- **Self-describing scene** — all import metadata stored as custom Maya attributes
- **Multi-model support** — multiple PMX models can coexist in the same scene, targeted via selection

### Fixed

- IK bones no longer reported as unsupported during validation
- Joint orientation preserved when controllers are created for fixed-axis or bone-morph bones
- Euler angle flips (gimbal lock) in VMD animation
- IK handle hierarchy and rest-pose capture
- Visible mesh seams caused by unlocked vertex normals
